Feedback on http://msgehard.github.com/ruby-learning/

You are awesome to do this, thank you, Mike. No real specific feedback as the outline is good, in that it worked for me, so just some notes/thoughts as I went through.

I went back and forth on this being potentially aimed at someone who's never programmed at all. I wondered about pre-requisites and extra links, for example but in the end I think the http://mattdeboard.net/2011/11/23/how-i-became-a-programmer/ blog post kind of covers what's really needed, e.g. self-help, resourcefulness, etc. People will figure out what they need from the questions they find themselves asking.

Git Video Part 0 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaNGbk6HN9Y&feature=related video is good, just a bit out of date, but not so much that common sense can't overcome quickly.

Steps 2. Sign-up for a GitHub account and most of 3. Creating a repo are covered in Git Video Part 0. Likewise there's some Git setup in Chapter 1 of ProGit book. So maybe prompt people to skim through before starting so they can consolidate steps.

I'd already hit these pages by the time I got to the links for
How do I connect my local repositories to GitHub
How do I create a repository, make local changes and then push those changes to GitHub
However, they are probably still helpful as other people will likely decide to work through the steps differently than I did. I setup alongside the video, having skimmed through to see what the goals were.

Slightly related note: I plan to fork Git help and a brief bit of troubleshooting for adding your private key to your keychain... guess what I forgot to do :) Only took me a sec to figure out, but might help someone else sometime.

Thought I'd stop here and tweet as requested, so you know who's about to fork your LearnRubyTheHardWay. Looking forward to it - thanks again!
